MonkOS
======

MonkOS is a 64-bit operating system for Intel and AMD processors. It is
a work in progress. Currently, it consists only of a boot loader and a stub
kernel.

The boot loader is designed to launch the operating system from a bootable
El Torito ISO9660-formatted cdrom.

###Prerequisites

The OS currently builds under linux.  To build it, you must have the
following tools installed:
* gcc x86_64 cross-compiler
* gnu binutils
* NASM assembler
* genisoimage
* gdb (for debugging)
* qemu (optional, for testing)
* doxygen (optional)

See [this page](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) for instructions
on installing a cross-compiler.
