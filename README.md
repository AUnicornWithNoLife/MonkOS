MonkOS
======

MonkOS is an experimental 64-bit operating system for Intel and AMD
processors. It is a work in progress. Currently, it consists of a BIOS boot
loader, a virtual console system, and a keyboard interrupt handler. The boot
loader is designed to launch the operating system from a cdrom. The code
is a mix of C and assembly language.

###Prerequisites

The OS currently builds under linux.  To build it, you must have the following
tools installed:
* gcc x86_64 cross-compiler (I used version 5.3)
* gnu binutils (I used version 2.26)
* NASM assembler
* genisoimage
* gdb (for debugging)
* qemu (optional, for testing)
* doxygen (optional)

See [this page](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) for instructions
on installing a gcc cross-compiler.

When building libgcc, make sure to follow the [libgcc without red-
zone](http://wiki.osdev.org/Libgcc_without_red_zone) instructions. Note that
these instructions are a bit out of date. If you are using a more recent
version of gcc (such as 5.3), you'll need to modify the gcc/config.gcc file
(not gcc/config.cc).

understand the numerous and various aspects of bootloader and OS development:
